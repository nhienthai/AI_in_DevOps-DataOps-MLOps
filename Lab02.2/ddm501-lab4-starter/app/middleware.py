"""
Middleware for collecting HTTP metrics.

This module implements a Starlette middleware that automatically
records metrics for all HTTP requests.

TODO: Complete the middleware implementation below.

The middleware should:
1. Record the start time before processing the request
2. Call the next handler to process the request
3. Calculate the duration after the response is ready
4. Record metrics (request count and latency)
